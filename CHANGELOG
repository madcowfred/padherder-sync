0.1.2
-----
* Added logic for removing monsters the user no longer possesses, as long as they are not
  members of any teams (thanks Bill Krueger).
* Probably fixed the HTTPS bug accidentally while making a fresh certificate post-Heartbleed.

0.1.1
-----
* Tried (and failed) to fix a horrible annoying Windows-specific OpenSSL certificate error.
  Apparently my perfectly valid SSL certificate is invalid.
* Fixed the USAGE text not saying 'padherder_sync.exe' when using the py2exe binary.
